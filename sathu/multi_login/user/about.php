            St. Francis College for Women is a Catholic Minority Institution. It was founded in 1959 by the Sisters of Charity for the empowerment of women through a value – based holistic education. The UGC conferred Autonomy on the college in the year 1988. The College has been awarded the status
            of College with Potential for Excellence by the UGC in the year 2004 in recognition of its sustained efforts to promote quality education for women. This created an academic ambience for promoting innovation and creativity in the curriculum of the college. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)
            has Reaccredited the college at the ‘ A’ Level in February 2006. It is a matter of pride for all concerned that our Curriculum, Teaching - Learning and Evaluation and Infrastructure facilities have been graded at the ‘A+’ Level. This is a further boost to the college in its commitment to quality education and academic excellence.
            In keeping with the changing trends in the field of higher education at the global scenario, the college is introducing Inter Disciplinary Electives (IDE) as an integral part of Choice and Credit Based Semester
            System from June 2006. This is a positive step towards achieving parity with educational institutions elsewhere in the world.
